# Symbolic-Governed Mistral-7B â€” Governance Artifact

This model is a sealed governance-layered variant of Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2, governed by a symbolic enforcement mesh.

## Governance Properties

- Tier 10 output freeze (post-deployment immutability)
- Contradiction tracking and truth-locking
- Symbolic output postprocessor
- No fine-tuning; base model untouched
- Hugging Face model card: https://huggingface.co/xbud/symbolic-governed-mistral

## Self-Evaluated Benchmarks (Symbolic Exact-Match)
