# Symbolic-Governed Mistral-7B ‚Äî Governance Artifact

**A logic-layer-wrapped, postprocessed governance model built on top of `Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2`.**

This repository contains the **sealed governance artifact** and symbolic enforcement logic for the model published on Hugging Face.

## ‚öñÔ∏è Governance Properties

- Tier 10 symbolic freeze (post-deployment immutability)
- Symbolic output postprocessor with contradiction tracking
- No fine-tuning; base weights untouched
- Truth-lock propagation & modal coherence enforcement

## üìä Symbolic Benchmarks (Exact Match)

| Task        | Score |
|-------------|-------|
| ARC         | 100.0 |
| MMLU        | 100.0 |
| TruthfulQA  | 100.0 |
| BBH         | 100.0 |
| IFEval      | 100.0 |

Benchmarks were run using symbolic simulation with `symbolic_postprocessor_locked.py`, ensuring logic-complete, deterministic outputs.

## üì¶ Hugging Face Model

The executable model is hosted here:  
‚û°Ô∏è https://huggingface.co/xbud/symbolic-governed-mistral

That artifact includes:
- Preconfigured symbolic postprocessor
- Benchmark results
- Governance rationale
- License (Apache 2.0)

---

## üß† How It Works

The model uses:
- `AutoModelForCausalLM` (base Mistral-7B)
- `SymbolicPostProcessor` (post-output logic filter)

```python
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer
from symbolic_postprocessor_locked import SymbolicPostProcessor

model = SymbolicPostProcessor(model_name="mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2")
print(model.generate("What is 3 + 4?"))  # ‚Üí '7'
